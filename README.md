# HPO - Hidden Markov Model Based Persian OCR 

A Hidden Markov Model Based Persian OCR . 
This was originally a the Project of Artificial Intelligance Course at Iran University of Science and Technology . 

# Requirements 

## Abstract Understanding on Hidden Markov Models
While a wide variaty of papers and resources could be found, i personally found the below two resources the best. 
+  [A tutorial on hidden Markov models and selected applications in speech recognition ]() 
+  [Matemathicalmonk Youtube playlist on Machine lerning ( HMM Section )](https://www.youtube.com/user/mathematicalmonk/playlists)

It's recomended to read the first paper mentioned above ( or just take a short look ) and then countinue the rest of the steps.


## Development Dependencies 
This project is entirely dependent on a variaty of open source softwares listed briefly below. a link and a short reason of usage is provided.  
+ [HTK - Hidden Markov Model Toolkit](http://htk.eng.cam.ac.uk/) : used mainly to perform both training and regnition phases. it is indeed one of the bets and most adaptable HMM Implementations. while it's optimized for speech recognition task, it is not limited to it. 
+ [NETPBM Image Processing Libraries](http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/) : Used mainly to convert image files to binary format and prepare them for feature extraction. 
+ [SRILM Language Modeling Tool](http://www.speech.sri.com/projects/srilm/download.html) : used as a parthner alongside HTK for language modeling  
+ [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php) / pango-view / Cario : used for generating image train data.
